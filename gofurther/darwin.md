# Darwin-based operating systems

> Phyllome OS **strongly** discourages users from virtualizing proprietary, darwin-based operating systems on non-Apple hardware. The Phyllome OS Project will take any possible measures to shutdown threads that mention such setup on platforms it has control over.

> That being said, it is perfectly legal to virtualize open-source, darwin-based operating systems surch as [PureDarwin](https://www.puredarwin.org/), even on non-Apple hardware. As a result, Phyllome OS **strongly** encourage users to do so.
