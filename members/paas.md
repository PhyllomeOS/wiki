# Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

* **Description** : [Cloudron.io](https://www.cloudron.io/) is used to deploy web applications consumed by the Phyllome OS project 
* **Status** : `online`
* **Location** : https://my.refre.ch
* **Maintainer** : lukas@phyllo.me

Cloudron.io is a PaaS used to deploy and keep web applications up-do-date. It is our beloved single point-of-failure.

openLDAP is made through so you can access most applications using a single account.

Alas, there is no SSO, so at first, you may have to login each and every applications.
