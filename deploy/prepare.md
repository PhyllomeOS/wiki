# Prepare the host computer

## Prerequisites

### Minimum requirements

- A **[x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)** computer which supports [**hardware-assisted virtualization**](/virt/lexicon#hardware-assisted-virtualization), which means:
	- For AMD-based configurations: **AMD V** is available and [enabled](/deploy/prepare#enable-hardware-assisted-virtualization)
  - For Intel-based configurations: **Intel VT-x** [is available](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/search/featurefilter.html?productType=873&2_VTX=true) and [enabled](/deploy/prepare#enable-hardware-assisted-virtualization)
- A **2-core** processor
- **4 GB** of RAM
- **10 GB** of **hard disk** storage space for Phyllome OS
- **250 GB** of **hard disk** storage space to store guest OS disk images

> Most computers sold after 2015 support hardware-assisted virtualization
{.is-info}

> Desktop motherboards are often better candidates for running virtualization-oriented workloads, as laptop motherboards often ship with chipsets that do not support hardware-assisted virtualization
{.is-info}

### Recommended requirements

- A **x86-64** computer that supports the **2nd gen** of **hardware-assisted virtualization**
	- For AMD-based configurations: **AMD Vi** is available and [enabled](/deploy/prepare#enable-hardware-assisted-virtualization)
  - For Intel-based configurations: **Intel VT-d** [is available](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/search/featurefilter.html?productType=873&0_VTD=True) and [enabled](/deploy/prepare#enable-hardware-assisted-virtualization)
* A **4-core** processor
* **16 GB** of RAM
- **10 GB** of **SSD** or **NVMe** storage space for Phyllome OS
* **1Â TB** of **SSD** or **NVMe** storage space to store guest OS disk images
* **Two graphics cards** or a graphics card that supports [vfio-mdev](/gofurther/vfio-mdev) or SR-IOV

> Sitting idle, Phyllome OS consumes approximately 1 CPU core and 1.5 GB of RAM. This requirement scales up with the number of running virtual machines
{.is-info}

## Enabling hardware-assisted virtualization

Hardware-assisted virtualization is rarely turned on by default, even on computers that support it: this section explains how to enable it.

> Failing to enable hardware-assisted virtualization will make running virtual machines extremly **slow**, if possible at all. If it cannot be enabled, you would be better off picking a Linux distribution which doesn't require it, such as [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/) or [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)
{.is-warning}

### Accessing the platform firmware interface on Windows

Enabling hardware-assisted virtualization requires accessing the firmware configuration tool of your motherboard, better known as the BIOS or UEFI. This process differs depending on which operating system is currently installed on the computer you intend to install Phyllome OS on.

#### Command-line instructions for Windows 8 and newer

Press the <kbd>Win</kbd> and <kbd>X</kbd> keys simultaneously to make a context menu appear. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>a</kbd> to open PowerShell using elevated privileges and click on the *Yes* button to bypass the User Account Control pop-up. Finally, input the following command inside the command prompt and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

```
shutdown /fw /r
``` 
#### Windows 8 and newer: a visual walk-through

* Open the start-up menu and write "start-up", then select *Change advanced start-up options*

![windows-firmware-1.png](/assets/windows-access-firmware/windows-firmware-1.png)

* Under the *Advanced start-up* section, click on *Restart now* 

![windows-firmware-2](/assets/windows-access-firmware/windows-firmware-2.png)

* Select *Troubleshoot*

![windows-firmware-3](/assets/windows-access-firmware/windows-firmware-3.png)
	
* Then select *Advanced options*

![windows-firmware-4](/assets/windows-access-firmware/windows-firmware-4.png)

* Select *UEFI Firmware Settings*

![windows-firmware-5](/assets/windows-access-firmware/windows-firmware-5.png)

* Hit *Restart*

![windows-firmware-6](/assets/windows-access-firmware/windows-firmware-6.png)

* Go to the section [Modify the firmware configuration](/deploy/prepare#modify-the-firmware-configuration) to learn what to do next.

#### MacOS-based computers

Hardware-assisted virtualization is a hit or miss on Apple computers, as there is no way to access the platform firmware interface on these computers. 

Apple users can go to the [installation section](https://wiki.phyllo.me/deploy/medium) directly, create a USB stick and hope that hardware-assisted virtualization will be supported.

#### Other computers

Make sure the targeted computer is shut down.  

During the POST phase, you need to press a certain key to access the firmware configuration tool for your motherboard, which is part of your BIOS or UEFI. 

Just after pressing the <kbd>power</kbd> button, hit the right key to access the firmware configuration tool, usually <kbd>F2</kbd> or <kbd>Del</kbd>, but it may be another keystroke on your model.

> Do not hesitate to repeatedly press the pertinent key as soon has your computer has started, to make sure it is registered
{.is-info}

### Modify the firmware configuration

Unfortunately, most firmware configuration tool do differ, and the steps here might not be identical on your current platform. In general, the sought after features are found under the *Security* tab.

For an AMD-based computer, you need to look for references to *AMD SVM*, AMD V or AMD Vi. For an Intel-based computer, you need to look for *Intel VT-x* and *Intel VT-d*. 

It is also possible that the feature will be referred simply to as *Virtualization*. In that case, you may not know if it actually refers to IOMMU-based or non-IOMMU-based hardware-assisted virtualization.

Make sure you enable these options and choose to *save and exit*, which will reboot your computer.

#### A visual walk-through for Intel-based NUC

Here is a visual walk-through for an Intel NUC computer.

* After you have pressed the <kbd>F2</kbd> key on boot, this screen should appear.

![efi-1.png](/assets/intel-efi/efi_boot-order-1.png)

* Go to the *Security* tab. Under the *Security Features* menu, you will find two options, *Intel Virtualization Technology* and *Intel VT for Directed I/O (VT-d)*. 

![efi-2.png](/assets/intel-efi/efi-2.png)

* Check these boxes

![efi-4.png](/assets/intel-efi/efi-4.png)

Then *save and exit* the configuration tool, which will reboot your computer.

> *While you are there, you could also change the boot order, to make sure that your computer will boot from an attached USB thumb drive first when it will be time to try out Phyllome OS.*
{.is-info}

### Modify the boot order permanently

This section will show you how to modify the boot order permanently, so you can boot from a USB flash drive attached to your computer, a necessary step to install or use Phyllome OS as a live system. 

* Go to the *Boot* tab

![efi_boot-order-1.png](/assets/intel-efi/efi_boot-order-1.png)

* Under the *UEFI Boot Priority* menu, you may notice that Fedora, which is installed on the internal storage device, is in the first position    

![efi_boot-order-2.png](/assets/intel-efi/efi_boot-order-2.png)

* Move the USB Flash Drive to the first position instead, as shown in the screenshot below

![efi_boot-order-3.png](/assets/intel-efi/efi_boot-order-3.png)

* That's it. Save changes and exist. Note that it is advisable to revert these changes after a successful installation, or to only change the bootloader temporary.

*If the activation is successful, you can go to [**the next section**](/deploy/medium) to prepare an installation medium.*
