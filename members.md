# Welcome to Phyllome OS !

## Introduction

This file is made to ease the onboarding of new people into the Phyllome OS project.

## At the beginning

When you onboard the project, you will eventually get an account on https://my.refre.ch, which will allow you to access applications used by the Phyllome OS project.

To receive an invitation, you need to possess a working email address, typically your personal email address. Then, you should receive an email inviting you to register.

> If you haven't received your invitation, please check your spam folder. If there is nothing there, please send an email to `contact@phyllo.me` and mention your username

> **Password**. Please use a long passphrase and store it securely, using a password manager such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [KeePaasXC](https://keepassxc.org/), or on an air-gapped hardware token made of cellulose fibres, also known as a sheet of paper.
