# On KVM virtualization

*In this section, the focus is on KVM virtualization, and its associated tools, including QEMU, the Linux Kernel, `libvirt`, etc., mostly in the context of Phyllome OS.* 

## Guest operating systems

*[This sub-section](/virt/guest) provides a reference for guest operating systems used in KVM-powered virtual machines, and their current support.*

* [ReactOS](/virt/guest/reactos)
* ...and [**more**](/virt/guest)

## The host operating system

*[This sub-section](/virt/host) provides a reference for the host operating system.*

* [Linux Kernel modules](/virt/host/modules) related to virtualization
* [Virtualization-related paths](/virt/host/paths) on Phyllome OS
* [XML](/virt/host/xml) commented

## Virtual hardware

*[This sub-section](/virt/host) provides a reference for the host operating system.*

* [Anatomy of a virtual machine](/virt/vm)
	* [Chipset](/virt/chipset)
* [Paravirtualized hardware](/virt/virtio) (`virtio`)

### Bare-metal hardware

## Resources

* [A very short history](/virt/history) of virtualization
* [Lexicon](/virt/lexicon)
