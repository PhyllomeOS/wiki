# On KVM virtualization

*In this section, the focus is on KVM virtualization, and its associated tools, including QEMU, the Linux Kernel, `libvirt`, etc., mostly in the context of Phyllome OS.* 

## Guest operating systems

*[This sub-section](/virt/guest) provides a reference for guest operating systems used in KVM-powered virtual machines, and their current support.*

* [ReactOS](/virt/guest/reactos)
* ...and [**more**](/virt/guest)

## The host operating system

*[This sub-section](/virt/host) provides a reference for the host operating system.*

* [Linux Kernel modules](/virt/host/modules) related to virtualization
* [Virtualization-related paths](/virt/host/paths) on Phyllome OS
* [XML](/virt/host/xml) commented

## Virtual hardware

*[This sub-section](/virt/vm) provides a reference for the virtual hardware.*

* [Chipset](/virt/vm/chipset)
* [Firmware](/virt/vm/firmware)
* [Virtual I/O Devices](/virt/vm/virtio) (`virtio`)

## Physical hardware

*This sub-section will include about the physical hardware.*

## Resources

* [A very short history](/virt/history) of virtualization
