# Introduction

## Welcome to Phyllome's OS wiki !

As of now, there are three main sections :

* **Users** : How to install and use Phyllome OS (work in progress)
* **Developpers** : How to hack Phyllome OS (work in progress)
* **The Phyllome Project** : How the project is currently set-up (work in progress)

If you would rather avoid JavaScript altogether, or wish to download the content locally, we got you covered as you can download the content [here](https://git.phyllo.me/home/wiki) using git. 

Happy reading !

## Disclaimer

Phyllome OS is not yet ready for prime time. Please come in a few months to test it out.
