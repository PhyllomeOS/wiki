# Phyllome OS wiki

`Welcome to the Phyllome OS wiki! `

*In this wiki, you will find guides about how to install, use and hack Phyllome OS, as well as more general information about open-source virtualization and the project behind this specialized OS.*

*[Phyllome OS](https://phyllo.me/) is an operating system that makes it easier to run various guest systems locally using [off-the-shelf hardware](https://wiki.phyllo.me/deploy/prepare).*

*If you want to learn more about it, its goal and the context around it, have a look at the [white-paper](https://files.phyllo.me/s/oYwfxYpZcbppwr6).*

## Deploy

*This section is meant to help users prepare their computers to host Phyllome OS, pick the version that will suit their needs, understand Phyllome OS' limitations, and install it.*

> Phyllome OS is **not** production-ready. The alpha version [has been released](https://github.com/PhyllomeOS/phyllomeos/releases) on November the 15h, 2021. The beta version is expected somewhere in 2022. And the production-ready version will be released *when it is done*. As of November 2021, it is a self-funded, experimental and mostly solo project, but [contributions are welcome!](/project/contribute)

### Tasks related to the guest OS

*Although Phyllome OS thrives to pick good defaults that will work for many guest systems, further optimizations may be needed.* 

* [Install a Linux guest](/gofurther/install-guest) system using an ISO file
* [Install a Windows guest](/gofurther/install-windows-guest) system using an ISO file
* ...and [**more**](https://wiki.phyllo.me/en/gofurther)

*This section is meant to introduce the execution of particular taks on Phyllome OS. Some of these tasks will be rendered obsolete with newer Phyllome OS versions.*
