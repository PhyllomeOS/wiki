# Phyllome OS as a live system

> Phyllome OS is not yet ready to be used daily as a live system.
{.is-warning}

Using Phyllome OS as a live system is a great way to test it out and make sure your host computer is up to the task, before committing to a [permanent installation](/deploy/live), which is currently the recommended way to use Phyllome OS.

## Use it daily

>  At the moment, changes applied to a Phyllome OS Live medium do not persist across reboots.
{.is-info}

Under certain conditions, you may want to use a live system daily, provided that the disk and [XML configuration](/virt/xml) of your virtual machine disks are stored outside the USB thumb drive.
