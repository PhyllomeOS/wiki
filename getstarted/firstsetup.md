* **Keyboard layout**: you can select your favorite keyboard layout by clicking on the three stacked vertical dots at the bottom of the screen.

> By default, Phyllome OS is set to use the *fr-CH* keyboard layout. This keyboard layout is used by people living in [Romandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romandy), Switzerland, which is also where the original author of Phyllome OS is from.
