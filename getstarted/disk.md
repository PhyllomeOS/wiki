# How to use Phyllome OS daily

> Phyllome OS is not yet production ready. Use it if you wish to contribute.
{.is-warning}

**Phyllome OS has one overeaching goal: to let you pick your favorite operating system and to run it.**

As a result, using Phyllome OS means to put yourself in a situation where you don't actually have to manage it, so that you can spend most of your time inside your favorite personnal computing environment, and not messing with Phyllome OS itself. [^1]

Concretely, to reach this state, and be able to use Phyllome OS daily without realizing that trully are living in a virtual world:

* **Create a virtual machine**
	* automatically using `virt-install`
  * manually using `virt-manager`
* **Install your favorite guest operating system** inside this virtual machine
  * automatically using a kickstart file, for compatible guest systems
  * manually, using the installer provided by your operating system editor 
* **Learn how make the most out of it**

As Phyllome OS evolves, one of the main goal is to shorten the time it would take for an end-user to have a fully operationnal virtual machine running with favorite operating system optimized virtual machine with their favorite operating system.
