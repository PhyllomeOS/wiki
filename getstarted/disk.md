# How to use Phyllome OS daily

*This section explains how to further configure Phyllome OS, and how to deploy your favorite operating system within it.*   

## Post-installation configuration

After Phyllome OS [has been successfully installed](/deploy/install) and [the first-launch process has been completed](/deploy/install#first-launch), a few tasks are required before it can be used to its fullest potential.

> As Phyllome OS evolves, one of the main goal is to shorten the time it would take for an end-user to have a fully operational virtual machine loaded with the installer of their favorite operating system, to the point that a user may not see the Phyllome OS Desktop environnement at all.

### Correct 

Grant the current user 


## What to do next

* **Create a virtual machine**
  * manually, using `virt-manager` (*default*)
  * automatically, using `virt-install` (*for power users*)
* **Install your favorite guest operating system** inside this virtual machine
  * manually, using the installer provided by the editor of your favorite operating system 
  * automatically, using a kickstart file, for compatible guest systems
