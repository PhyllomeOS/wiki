# Commandments

Phyllome OS tries to stick to three generic rules or commandments, which can be summed up as follows : Phyllome OS should stay out of users’ way and allow them to run their current operating system well.

* **Stay out of my way**
	* Users shouldn’t have to spend much time managing Phyllome OS.

* **Run my current operating system**[^1]
 	* Phyllome OS is designed to be the coziest home for a user’s favorite operating system36, not a replacement for it. Users should be able to continue to use their preferred operating system.

[^1]: Such compatible guests include Linux, Windows NT and Darwin-based OS.

* **Run it well**
	* Most users will only want to run one, or at most a handful of, virtual machines  concurrently [^2], just as most users only use one machine at a time. Phyllome OS should attempt to maximize the performance of the virtual machine it hosts, with the goal of matching its physical counterpart.
  
[^2]: Of course, power-users will be able to run as many systems as their hardware allows.
