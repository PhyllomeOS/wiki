# Use cases

* **Run multiple guest operating systems concurrently**
	* Plug in two screens, two sets of keyboards, and two mice to the same PC and spawn two machines to do graphic intensive tasks such as gaming or 3D modeling. No need to buy another computer, just split the one you already have.

* **Painlessly move to new hardware**
	* When virtualized, your operating system is just a file on Phyllome OS' disk. You can move and restore it on another computer, provided that the targeted host runs Phyllome OS.

* **Make your current hardware last longer**
	* Most recent versions of modern operating systems require recent hardware to function, and may not work on otherwise perfectly functioning hardware. By providing modern virtual hardware, Phyllome OS allows users to receive operating system updates, despite the fact that their underlying may not officially be supported.

* **Go beyond what your physical hardware is capable of**
	* A virtual display in a virtual machine can be set to a resolution that exceeds what the underling physical display is capable of, and such a virtual display may be accessible remotely, over the network.
