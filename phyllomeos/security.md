# Security in Phyllome OS

Currently, Phyllome OS does **not** provide any kind of encryption by default at the host level. Filesystem-level encryption is just one line of defense. For any virtual disks that contains personal data, users are strongly advised to use full-disk encryption as provided by their guest operating system.
