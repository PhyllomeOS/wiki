Phyllome OS makes a few assumptions, including the following ones: 

* **Virtual machines are performant enough to host personal computing environments**
* **Phyllome OS, the host operating system, should not be modified post-deployment**
	* Two Phyllome OS hosts should barely differ, allowing virtual machines to be migrated from one host to the next.
