# Guest operating systems support

> Phyllome OS ðŸ¤Ž other operating systems. It is meant to be a cozy platform for almost any modern operating systems to thrive.

Although Phyllome OS would like to support as many operating systems as possible, it mainly focuses on modern, UEFI-compatible operating systems that are shipping with at least some support for [virtio devices](/virt/lexicon#paravirtualization). 

## Category of operating systems

As of today, without accounting for Linux distributions, there are dozens of production-ready operating systems. 

That being said, there are two families of operating systems that dominate this space, the Unix family and the Windows family. Everything else will be categorized as independent. 

### UNIX-family

When it comes to its longevity and number of variants, the UNIX family is by far the most prolific family of all.

* **Linux**
	* Debian, Fedora, Android, Chromium OS, etc.
* **BSD** 
	* OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc.
  * Darwin-based operating systems, such as macOS
* **Solaris**
	* OpenSolaris, Illumnos, etc.

### Windows-family

* **Windows**
	* Windows and ReactOS

### Independent

* **SculptOS**
* **FuschiaOS**

## Support matrix

> Support for guest systems differs widely. In general, free and open-source operating systems such as Linux distributions are better supported than proprietary operating systems.
