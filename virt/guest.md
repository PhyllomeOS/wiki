# Guest operating system

> Phyllome OS ðŸ¤Ž other operating systems. It is meant to be a cozy platform for almost any modern operating systems to thrive.

Although Phyllome OS would like to support as many operating systems as possible, it focuses mainly on modern, UEFI-compatible operating systems that are shipping with at least some support for `virtio` devices. 

## Category of operating systems

As of today, without accounting for Linux distributions, there are dozens of production-ready operating systems. There are two families of operating systems that dominate this space, the Unix family and the Windows family. Everything else will be categorized as independent. 

### UNIX-family

When it comes to its longevity and number of variants, the UNIX family is by far the most prolific family of all.

* **Linux**
	* Debian, Fedora, Android, Chromium OS, etc.
* **BSD** 
	* OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc.
  * Darwin-based operating systems, such as macOS
* **Solaris**
	* OpenSolaris, Illumnos, etc.

### Windows-family

* **Windows**
	* Windows and [ReactOS](/virt/guest/reactos)

### Independent

* **SculptOS**
* **FuschiaOS**

## Support matrix

> *Support for guest systems differs widely. In general, free and open-source operating systems such as Linux distributions are better supported than proprietary operating systems*.
