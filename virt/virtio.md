# Paravirtual hardware

*Paravirtual hardware are emulated hardware or devices that can be found in a virtual environment. Contrary to other emulated hardware, they don't intend to mimic a particular piece of real hardware.*

In this section, the focus is oriented towards Virtual I/O Devices (VIRTIO), also known as the `virtio` family of devices.
